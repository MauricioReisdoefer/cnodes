Responsible for initialization, main loop, memory management,
timing control, and engine lifecycle.

### Math

Mathematical structures and utilities.
Includes vectors, matrices, transformations,
collision shapes, and related operations.

### Simulation

Game state and physics systems.
Handles physics updates, collision detection,
resolution, and all logic executed during SimulationUpdate.

### Features

Modular components attachable to Nodes.
Used to extend behavior such as rendering,
audio, input handling, and gameplay logic.
